 <h3>About</h3> <p>
     The primary goal of this project is to modernize and streamline the management process of production sectors that were previously reliant on manual and paper-based methods. This has been achieved through a dynamic Web application integrated with PIMS (PI System), that seamlessly collects data from the database and factory machines in real-time. The user interface is organized into four dashboards, each featuring draggable cards tailored to different subjects, facilitating daily meetings, capturing improvement opportunities, and providing production monitoring across different access levels. Designed to cater to operational, supervisory, and management areas.
